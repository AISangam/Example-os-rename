## Where this code is used  
Sometimes some one has written the images in a folder with dot dots. Such things happen by mistake and suppose you have tons of images, hence doing it manually is a very time consuming process. In such situation this code can be great use.  

## How it is implemented  
<ol>
  <li> Images are looped from the directory where they exists one by one.</li>
  <li> Logic is implemented to replace <b>the only first dot</b> with underscore</li>
  <li> The old filename is replaced with the new filename</li>
  </ol>

## How to run this code  

Since this is python file, hence one need to run the command  

```
python os.rename_program.py
```
